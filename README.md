# DiracX

This repository contains the code for DiracX.

It is still extremely incomplete. Check the [status board](https://github.com/orgs/DIRACGrid/projects/2/views/2).

The documentation is scatered in [various files](./docs/).

Check [here](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx-charts?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-demo-locally) to try it out.

Feel free to look around however try not to draw any conclusions as the code is still rapidly evolving.
